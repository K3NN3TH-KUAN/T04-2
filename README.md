## Data Story

### Who is the Audience?
This project is designed for Australian consumers who are interested in buying a new television and want affordable, energy-efficient and good-sized TVs. They also prefer simple, visual insights over technical details.

### Audience Interest in the Visualisation
The visualisations help users quickly understand:
- What TV technologies are most common in Australia?
- What screen sizes are most frequent?
- Which brands dominate the market?
- Which screen type uses the least power?
- What is the relationship between screen size and power use?
- What is the relationship between star rating and screen size?

## About the Data

### Data Source
The data is sourced from the Australian Government's Television Energy Rating dataset, which provides information on TV models, technologies, energy consumption details, and star ratings.

### Data Processing
The raw dataset was cleaned and filtered to focus on relevant fields such as TV brands, screen size, screen technologies, average mode power, availability status, star rating, submit ID and TVs sold in which countries. Charts were generated to highlight key trends and insights for consumers.

### Privacy
The dataset contains only product-level information and does not include any personal or sensitive data. All data used is publicly available and anonymised.

### Accuracy and Limitations
While the dataset is comprehensive, it may not include the very latest TV models or reflect recent changes in energy efficiency standards. Power consumption figures are based on manufacturer specifications and may vary with real-world usage. The visualisations provide general guidance and should not be used as the sole basis for purchasing decisions.

### Ethics
All data is used in accordance with the terms provided by the Australian Government. The project aims to promote energy awareness and responsible consumption without bias towards any particular brand or technology.
